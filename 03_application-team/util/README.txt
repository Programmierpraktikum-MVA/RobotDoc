MIMIC-IV-ED is a large database of patient admissions to an emergency department at an academic tertiary medical center. MIMIC-IV-ED is composed of a single patient tracking table, edstays, and five data tables: diagnosis, medrecon, pyxis, triage, and vitalsign.

Only credentialed users who have signed the data use agreement may access MIMIC-IV-ED. The dataset is licensed under the PhysioNet Credentialed Health Data License 1.5.0. A LICENSE file should have been provided to you, otherwise please see PhysioNet for detailed conditions of use.

Individual table descriptions follow.

edstays

Patient stays are tracked in the edstays table. Each row of the edstays table has a unique stay_id, which represents a unique patient stay in the ED. The edstays table contains the following columns: subject_id, hadm_id, stay_id, intime, and outtime. The intime indicates the time at which the patient was admitted to the ED, and the outtime indicates the time at which the patient was discharged from the ED. If the patient was admitted to the hospital following their ED stay, the hadm_id column will be populated with an identifier representing their hospital stay. hadm_id can be linked with the hadm_id in MIMIC-IV to obtain further detail about the patient’s hospital stay. Finally, each individual is assigned a unique subject_id, and patients with multiple ED stays will have the same subject_id across stays in the edstays table. Note that subject_id can be linked with MIMIC-IV to obtain patient demographics. subject_id can also be linked with the PatientID DICOM attribute in MIMIC-CXR to obtain chest x-rays for patients if they were taken.

diagnosis

The diagnosis table provides coded diagnoses for the patient in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Ninth or Tenth revision (ICD-9 or ICD-10). These diagnoses are determined by trained coders after hospital discharge and are used for hospital billing purposes. There are six columns in the diagnosis table: subject_id, stay_id, seq_num, icd_code, icd_version, and icd_title. A maximum of 9 ICD codes are available for a single stay. The seq_num column provides a pseudo-order for the ICD codes, with a value of 1 usually indicating highest relevance and a value of 9 indicating least relevance. The icd_code provides the coded representation of the diagnosis using the ICD ontology, the icd_version column is either 9 or 10 indicating whether the ontology used is ICD-9 or ICD-10, and the icd_title column provides the textual description of the ICD code.

medrecon

The medrecon table provides medicine reconciliation for each patient, that is a list of the medications which the patient was taking prior to their ED stay. The medrecon table has nine columns: subject_id, stay_id, charttime, name, gsn, ndc, etc_rn, etccode, and etcdescription. The charttime provides the date and time at which the medicine reconciliation was documented. The name column provides a text description of the medicine, the gsn column provides the Generic Sequence Number (GSN), and the ndc column provides the National Drug Code (NDC). Note a gsn or an ndc of 0 indicates that the value is missing. Columns prefixed with etc provide an ontology for grouping together drugs of a similar class. Note that as a medicine can be classified in multiple groups in the ontology, there may be more than one row for a single medication. For example, the medication Adderal is (1) a CNS stimulant, (2) an Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Therapy, and (3) a narcolepsy therapy. As a result, patients taking adderal prior to their admission will have three rows in the medrecon table, delineated by the sequential monotonically increasing integer etc_rn. The etccode provides the coded form of the ontology group, and the etcdescription proides the textual description of the ontology group.

pyxis

The pyxis table provides dispensation information for medications provided by the BD Pyxis MedStation, an automated medication dispensing system present in the ED. The pyxis table has nine columns: subject_id, stay_id, charttime, med_rn, name, gsn_rn, and gsn. The charttime provides the time at which the medication was dispensed. If multiple medications were dispensed at the same time, the med_rn column delineates these medications. The name column provides a textual description of the medication dispensed, and may additionally contain auxiliary information such as the formulation. The gsn column provides the Generic Sequence Number (GSN) if available, and gsn_rn delineates multiple GSN values associated with the same medication. Note that a gsn of 0 indicates that the GSN is missing.

triage

The triage table provide information collected from the patient at the time of triage. All patients who present to the ED are immediately triaged, a process which involves assessing their health status and ascertaining the reason for their visit. The triage table has eleven columns: subject_id, stay_id, temperature, heartrate, resprate, o2sat, sbp, dbp, pain, acuity, and chiefcomplaint. Vital signs collected at triage include patient temperature (temperature), heart rate (heartrate), respiratory rate (resprate), oxygen saturation (o2sat), systolic blood pressure (sbp), and diastolic blood pressure (dbp). Although vital signs can be documented as free-text, the deidentification approach retained only numeric vital signs. A patient reported pain level is available in the pain column. The chiefcomplaint is a free-text field which contains the patient’s reported reason for presenting to the ED. The chiefcomplaint field is usually a comma separated list of entries. PHI present in the chiefcomplaint field has been replaced by three underscores (’___’). Based upon the triage assessment, the care provider will assign an integer level of severity (acuity), where 1 indicates the highest severity and 5 indicates the lowest severity.

vitalsign

The vitalsign table contains aperiodic vital signs documented for patients during their stay. The vitalsign table has eleven columns: subject_id, stay_id, charttime, temperature, heartrate, resprate, o2sat, sbp, dbp, rhythm, and pain. Vital signs in the vitalsign table are similar to those collected in the triage table. The rhythm column additionally provides the heart rhythm for the patient. The charttime provides the time at which the vital signs were recorded.
